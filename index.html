        <p> Simply put, moss is a unique example of plant life that that is severely under appreciated.
            From it's humble beginnings as one of the first land based plants to it's high oxygen output there are 
            a multitude of reasons for us to give thanks for this dear friend. And this is ignoring the most 
            important aspect: Moss is <strong>cute</strong> as heck. Try and tell me that seeing some moss 
            on a big ol' rock isn't cute.<br>
            <br><strong>You can't.</strong>

        <p>Moss was one of the first plant to survive on dry land. They are cousins with algea (an equally important and cute plant). While
            algea was content to stay in their watery abode moss showed a level of spunk and moxy totally unseen at that time and struck
            out on their own to forge a new path for plant life everywhere. Algea sometimes follows this lead evidenced by it's presense on trees 
            and rocks in some areas. Most botonists agree that moss was <strong>one of the first</strong> examples of a land plant. As one would expect from such an intriquing and 
            distinguished plant moss is kept in it's own division:<em>Bryophyta</em>. Here are some other interesting distinguishing features of moss:
                <ul>
                    <li>They are a non vascular plant</li>
                    <li>Moss was used as a bandage for soldiers during WWI</li>
                    <li>Instead of getting their nutrients from a root system they derive nutrition from the air!</li>
                </ul>

    <h3>Where can I find the stuff?? </h3>
        <p>So you finally got a hankering for some moss action. Can't go another day without witnessing the blessing
            itself. "But wait" you you <strong>"Where the heck can I even find it?"</strong> As moss would say
            <em><strong>"BE NOT AFRAID".</strong></em>While you aren't likely to find moss in a desert climate or near salt
            water you can find it in most other places. As a result of being such an old school tuff
            boi plant they can grow on just about <strong>anything</strong> and just about <strong>anywhere</strong> (excluding 
            the previously mentioned areas). If you are truly on the hunt though, if you truly can't go another second without 
            the good stuff, moss's favorite areas are typically <em>shady</em> and <em>moist</em>. While on your search, remember,
            there are over 12,000 different species of moss wih different visual cues. If you com across some on your search,
            take a moment to appreciate some of the following features:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>lovely green hue</li>
                <li>fragrently earthy</li>
                <li>Soft enough to pat like an old friend</li>
            </ul>
